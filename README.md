## Script: Monitor_Long_Running_Queries.sql

**Description**:
This script captures real-time information about **currently running user queries**, including performance metrics, progress, and **wait types**. It's a powerful tool for DBAs to diagnose slow performance, blocking, or resource bottlenecks.

### üîß Query:
```sql
SELECT 
    r.session_id,
    DB_NAME(r.database_id) AS DatabaseName,
    r.command,
    r.status,
    r.wait_type,                                           
    r.percent_complete,
    DATEADD(MILLISECOND, r.estimated_completion_time, GETDATE()) AS Estimated_Completion,
    r.cpu_time,
    r.total_elapsed_time / 1000.0 AS ElapsedSeconds,
    r.reads,
    r.writes,
    r.logical_reads,
    r.blocking_session_id,
    t.text AS QueryText
FROM 
    sys.dm_exec_requests r
CROSS APPLY 
    sys.dm_exec_sql_text(r.sql_handle) t
WHERE 
    DB_NAME(r.database_id) NOT IN ('master', 'msdb', 'tempdb', 'model')
ORDER BY 
    r.total_elapsed_time DESC;
```

### ‚úÖ Use Case:
- Live query and workload monitoring
- Detect long-running and blocked sessions
- Identify queries waiting on resources (locks, memory, I/O)
- Improve troubleshooting response time
